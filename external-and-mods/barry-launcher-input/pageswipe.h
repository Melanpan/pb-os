// PageSwipe: pages side by side, pulled in and pushed away sideways. In
// Barry Launcher they are the performance dashboard, the apps (home) and
// the quick settings, left to right: a left-to-right swipe from anywhere
// brings in the page to the left, right to left the one to the right.
//
// It watches its children's touches (and mouse, for a test without a
// touchscreen) without taking them: a tap on a tile is still a tap. A touch
// becomes a swipe only once it has moved `threshold` pixels, mostly
// sideways, in a direction that moves the page; then the swipe takes the
// touch, and progress follows the finger. On release the page goes to the
// side it was thrown toward, or the nearer one, and settle() says where;
// the QML animates progress there (its look). A touch something keeps for
// itself (a slider with preventStealing) is never taken.
//
// Every finger is watched, and any of them can be the swipe: a thumb resting
// on the screen does not stop the other hand's swipe. Once one is, the
// others' touches are no taps (a thumb on a corner tile started its app as
// it lifted, 2026-10-17), nor are those that come down during the swipe or
// as the page settles. So it is with a finger moving that nothing uses (a
// swipe up over the tiles, a page swipe the wrong way): a hand passing over
// the screen, aiming at nothing, while a thumb holding the Thor rests on a
// tile (it started Deck, 2026-10-17).
//
// Barry coming in, touches are no taps for a moment (holdTaps: its tiles
// are still flying in); after a swipe up from the bottom edge opened it, a
// little longer where that thumb lifted (holdTapsBelow): on its way back to
// the edge it came down on Trackpad, Keyboard or Deck, the bottom row,
// a second after (2026-10-17).
//
// progress: which page shows, from minPage to maxPage. A left-to-right
// swipe raises it: the page at progress p is the one p places LEFT of page
// 0 (in Barry: 1 the dashboard, 0 home, -1 the quick settings). One swipe
// moves one page at most.
