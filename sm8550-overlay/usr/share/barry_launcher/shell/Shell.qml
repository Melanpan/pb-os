// Barry Launcher on the AYN Thor's bottom screen during Game Mode: the first
// window of barry_launcher_session, under everything else. Because this
// window is always shown, gamescope falls back to it when an app quits,
// instead of freezing on the app's last frame.
//
// Its base is the hero art of the game selected on the top screen
// (Hero.qml). Over it Barry opens and closes: a short press of the AYN
// button, or a swipe up from the bottom edge (barry_launcher_shelld says so
// in GET /home: "open", and "serial" counting each opening). Barry is three
// pages side by side: the performance dashboard, the apps (Home.qml) and
// the quick settings (QuickSettings.qml), left to right; it opens on the
// apps. A left-to-right swipe from anywhere brings in the page to the left,
// right to left the one to the right; Barry.Input's PageSwipe tells a swipe
// from a tap and says where it goes, and here it slides there, springing
// past a little and back, as the keyboard does coming up. An app's tile
// starts it (or brings it forward) through barry_launcher_shelld, and Barry
// closes; the AYN button opens Barry over it and closes back to it.
//
// Over an app, a swipe in from the left edge pulls in the dashboard, from
// the right edge the quick settings, like a phone's side panels, following
// the finger (Barry.Input's EdgeSwipe reads the touchscreen while the app has
// the touches); let go far enough or fast enough it stays, else it goes back.
// Swiped back toward the apps, Barry closes back to the app. Only one window
// shows on the bottom screen, so shelld takes a picture of the app as the
// finger comes down (POST /side-prepare; GET /home's under) and the page
// slides over that, and back off it, instead of the app giving way to the
// game art.
//
// The game art is standby. A tap on it wakes Barry too: its pages come over
// the art, which stays behind as if behind frosted glass (Hero.qml's
// frost), its logo gone. Untouched for standbySeconds (Barry's settings,
// 15 by default; 0: never), Barry goes back to the art, unless it is open
// over an app or on a side page (the dashboard and the quick settings stay
// until swiped back to the apps).
//
// The game art can be turned off (Barry's settings, heroArt, the PB-OS tab's
// Dual Screen page): Barry's pages then stay up on their own background, as
// before there was art, and the AYN button only goes to and from apps. In
// Desktop Mode ("desktop" argument, barry_launcher_desktop) it is always
// off: the art is Game Mode's, for the game selected in Steam.
//
// Opening, the apps fly in toward the screen, the middle ones first
// (Home.qml's dropIn, Barry.Input's TileDrop; a skin's home screen without
// it slides up instead): shelld counts the openings, this puts Barry at
// the start while still hidden and says so (/home-ready), and then the
// window is brought forward. Closing, it fades down and the hero shows
// again.
